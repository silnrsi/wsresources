The Unicode 7.0 standard includes 83 Pahawh Hmong characters that are allocated to
codepoints in the Private Use Area by the font's author.

The original Fixedsys Excelsior author said in the scripts page and image:
Pahawh Hmong is not part of Unicode yet!  Odd, because this is a living script that you
would think has priority over disused phonetic extensions, Glagolitic, Shavian and
Phags-Pa (all already encoded).  A proposal exists but has been sitting dead for years.
However, the proposal is well-thought and I used it as the model for my own Hmong in
the private use range.
